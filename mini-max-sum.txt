PROBLEM
Given five positive integers, find the minimum and maximum values that 
can be calculated by summing exactly four of the five integers. 
Then print the respective minimum and maximum values as a single line of 
two space-separated long integers.

Function Description

Complete the miniMaxSum function in the editor below.

miniMaxSum has the following parameter(s):

arr: an array of 5 integers

Print

Print two space-separated integers on one line: the minimum sum and the maximum sum of 4 of 5 elements.

Input Format

A single line of five space-separated integers.

Output Format

Print two space-separated long integers denoting the respective minimum and maximum values 
that can be calculated by summing exactly four of the five integers. 
(The output can be greater than a 32 bit integer.)

SOLUTION
function miniMaxSum(arr) {
    let i=0, sumMin=0, sumMax=0;
    while (i<arr.length) {
        let tempArr = [...arr]
        tempArr.splice(i,1)
        let sum = tempArr.reduce((accumulator, a)=> accumulator+a)
        if (sumMin===0 && sumMax===0) {
            sumMin = sum
            sumMax = sum
        }
        if (sum < sumMin) {
            sumMin = sum
        }
        if (sum > sumMax) {
            sumMax = sum
        }
        i++
    }
    console.log(sumMin, sumMax);
}
